#Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.
The problem I was facing is how to make it look aesthetic and visually appealing. 
It was very stressful and took a lot of time to make it look good. 
What I have learned is patience and learned to enjoy using turtles. 
My original vision of the project was to add more to scenes that you can choose. 
However, I tried to make the scenes that I have better.
